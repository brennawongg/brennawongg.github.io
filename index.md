### CPSC120

* [Lab 1](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-01-brennan-jia) & [Lab 2](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-02-brennan-and-gianna?search=1)

    +    Labs 1 & 2 were some of my favorites, because it gave me an easy insight into the course, I was able to meet my first lab partner and become a better team player. I also got to learn how to use git commands in contrast to normally using a compiler within VSCode.
* [Lab 6](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-06-melanie-and-brennan/tree/main/part-2)

    +   Lab 6, part 1 was a favorite since it allowed me to code a game of Blackjack. Along with practicing coding, I was able to somewhat learn the game since I'm not the most familiar with card games. I was able to code functions and make values dependent on others.
* [Lab 12](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-12-brennan-and-richard/tree/1a0ce63fb7e0e6af558ab0bd0c6c2ef3fedd7a7d/part-1)

    +   Lab 12, part 1 was a favorite since I've never really worked with gifs or animated code. I was able to learn simple code using the RGB scale and code functions to change the RGB values as the program runs. I also was able to use a sine_lookup_table which I had no idea what it was prior, I learned many different ways math could play into scaled values.
